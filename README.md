# TodoApi

  The program provides an API for the To Do List application. The API program is connected to the MYSQL data base management system located on the device in the local area network.
The program is written on the ASP.NET platform using a controller based on the MVC principle.
The database is created using the Entity Framework ORM as in the code first approach.
Thanks to Swagger technology based on openAPI, there is a graphical interface.
As we can see, standard CRUD operations are supported.
